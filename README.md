# Seq2Seq RNN based Gait Anomaly Detection from Smartphone Acquired Multimodal Motion Data
Deep learning approach to anomaly detection in gait data acquired through smartphone's multimodal sensors.
The proposed architecture takes advantage of RNN and CNN layers to implement a Sequence-to-Sequence feature extractor and a Convolutional classifier, check the paper for more details.</br>

## Project structure
The folders are organized as follows:
- `ALV/` contains the Android application **ActivityLoggerVideo** used for the data collection.
- `Seq2Seq-gait-analysis/` contains the inference code and details on how to use it.
- `Seq2Seq-gait-analysis/Data/` is a placeholder for the preprocessed gait sequences used for training and testing of the proposed network. Check the `Seq2Seq-gait-analysis/README.md` for more details.
