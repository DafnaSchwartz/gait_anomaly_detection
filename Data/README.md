# Seq2Seq RNN based Gait Anomaly Detection from Smartphone Acquired Multimodal Motion Data
Deep learning approach to anomaly detection in gait data acquired through smartphone's multimodal sensors.
The proposed architecture takes advantage of RNN and CNN layers to implement a Sequence-to-Sequence feature extractor and a Convolutional classifier, check the paper for mode details.</br>

TBD when paper is accepted 
```

## Project structure
The folder are organized as follows:
- `/Data/` contains all recorded gait sequences used for training and testing of the proposed network.
- `/Software/ALV/` contains the android application **ActivityLoggerVideo** used for the data collection.
- `/Software/Seq2Seq-gait-analysis/` contains the inference code which results are reported in the paper.
</br>

**Check each folder for more details**.
